# Predicting Loan amount

In Banking industry, loan applications are generally approved after a thorough background check of the customer's repayment capabilities. Credit Score plays a significant role in identifying customer's financial behavior (specifically default). However, people belonging to rural India don't have credit score and it is difficult to do a direct assessment.

Based on the information that is collected for loan applications of rural customers, we need to understand the maximum repayment capability of customers which can be used to grant them the desired amount.
